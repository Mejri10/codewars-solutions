#Task:
Write a function that gets a square of a number without the following:

* Your code musn't contain any `*`s and you cannot use the `pow` function. **Edit: You also cannot use **`__mul__`** function**
* You cannot import any external libraries (unless you are satisfied with `random` being pre-imported).
* Only one function can be defined.
* Your code must be under or equal to 50 characters (and you already have to use 6 for the function name).
* Loophole solutions will not be accepted.
* If I use `test.expect` in my restriction tests, **that is okay.** This is not an issue.
* Input will always be positive or 0

Example of a loophole solution:

```python
square=lambda n:eval(')2,n(wop'[::-1])
```
