## Prime Factors

_Inspired by one of Uncle Bob's TDD Kata_

Write a function that generates factors for a given number.

The function takes an `integer` on the standard input and returns a list of integers (ObjC: array of `NSNumber`s representing integers). That list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence.


## Examples

```py
1  ==>  []
3  ==>  [3]
8  ==>  [2, 2, 2]
9  ==>  [3, 3]
12 ==>  [2, 2, 3]
```
