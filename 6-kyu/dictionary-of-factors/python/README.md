The objective of this Kata is to write a function that creates a dictonary of factors for a given set of numbers.<p>

The key for each list in the dictionary should be the number. The list associated with each key should possess the factors for the number.<p>

If a number possesses no factors (only 1 and the number itself), the list for the key should state 'None'.

The function possesses two agruments (n and m). Where n is the starting number and m is the ending number.

Ex: All factors for 2 (n) Through 6 (m) with the number being the key in the dictionary:<p>

{2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]}
