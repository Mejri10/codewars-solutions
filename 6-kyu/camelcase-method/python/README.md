Write simple .camelCase method (`camel_case` function in PHP or `CamelCase` in C#) for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

For instance:

```javascript
"hello case".camelCase() => HelloCase
"camel case word".camelCase() => CamelCaseWord
```
```python
camelcase("hello case") => HelloCase
camelcase("camel case word") => CamelCaseWord
```
```ruby
'hello case'.camelcase => HelloCase
'camel case word'.camelcase => CamelCaseWord
```
```crystal
"hello case".camelcase => HelloCase
"camel case word".camelcase => CamelCaseWord
```
```php
camel_case("hello case"); // => "HelloCase"
camel_case("camel case word"); // => "CamelCaseWord"
```
```cpp
camelCase("hello case"); // => "HelloCase"
camelCase("camel case word"); // => "CamelCaseWord"
```
```c#
using Kata;

"hello case".CamelCase(); // => "HelloCase"
"camel case word".CamelCase(); // => "CamelCaseWord"
```

Don't forget to rate this kata! Thanks :)
