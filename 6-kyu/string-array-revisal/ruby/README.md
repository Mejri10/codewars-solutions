In this Kata, you will be given an array of strings and your task is to remove all consecutive duplicate letters from each string in the array.

For example: 

  * `dup(["abracadabra","allottee","assessee"]) = ["abracadabra","alote","asese"]`. 
  
  * `dup(["kelless","keenness"]) = ["keles","kenes"]`.

Strings will be alphabet characters only. Don't worry about lower and upper case. See test cases for more examples. 
  
Good luck!
