Consider an array that has no prime numbers, and none of its elements has any prime digit. It would start with: `[1,4,6,8,9,10,14,16,18,..]`.  The element at `index 1` is `4`. 

`12` and `15` are not in the list because `2` and `5` are primes.

You will be given an integer `n` and your task will be return the number at that index in the array. For example, `solve(1) = 4`, as explained above. 

More examples in the test cases.

Good luck!
