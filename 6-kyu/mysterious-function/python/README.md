Among the ruins of an ancient city a group of archaeologists found a mysterious function with lots of HOLES in it called ```getNum(n)``` (or `get_num(n)` in ruby, python, or r). They tried to call it with some arguments. And finally they got this journal:
```javascript
getNum(300) #-> returns 2
getNum(90783) #-> returns 4
getNum(123321) #-> returns 0
getNum(89282350306) #-> returns 8
getNum(3479283469) #-> returns 5
```
```haskell
getNum 300          `shouldBe` 2
getNum 90783        `shouldBe` 4
getNum 123321       `shouldBe` 0
getNum 89282350306  `shouldBe` 8
getNum 3479283469   `shouldBe` 5
```
```r
get_num(300)
[1] 2
get_num(90783)
[1] 4
get_num(123321)
[1] 0
get_num(89282350306)
[1] 8
get_num(3479283469)
[1] 5
```
The archaeologists were totally stuck with this challenge. They were all in desperation but then.... came YOU the SUPER-AWESOME programmer. Will you be able to understand the mystery of this function and rewrite it?
