# Is Prime

Define a function `isPrime`/`is_prime()` that takes one integer argument and returns `true`/`True` or `false`/`False` depending on if the integer is a prime.

Per Wikipedia, a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Example

```ruby
isPrime(5)
=> true
```
```r
is_prime(7)
[1] TRUE
```
```csharp
Kata.IsPrime(5) => true
```
```php
is_prime(5); // => true
```

## Assumptions

* You can assume you will be given an integer input.
* You can not assume that the integer will be only positive. You may be given negative numbers as well (or `0`).
