<s>My first Kata! Yay!</s> Most Probably gonna remove this later

In this Kata you have to find the factors of <code>integer</code> down to the <code>limit</code> including the limiting number. There will be no negative numbers.  Return the result as an array of numbers in ascending order.

If the <code>limit</code> is more than the <code>integer</code>, return an empty list

As a challenge, see if you can do it in one line
