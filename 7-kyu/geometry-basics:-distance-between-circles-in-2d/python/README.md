This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

Point objects have `x`, `y` attributes.
Circle objects have `center` which is a `Point`, and `radius` which is a number.

Write a function calculating distance between `Circle a` and `Circle b`.

If they're overlapping or one is completely within the other, just return zero.

Tests round answers to 6 decimal places, so you don't need to round them yourselves.
