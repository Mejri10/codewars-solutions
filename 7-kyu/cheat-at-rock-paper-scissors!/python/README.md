You seem to have the worst luck at rock, paper, scissors! Everyday you play against your friends, but never win. You want a taste of victory!

In this kata you need to define `r_p_s_cheat()` that takes an argument, either `'rock'`, `'paper'`, or `'scissors'` and returns your counter to win!

But there's a catch! Your friends know how terrible you are at rock, paper, scissors, and if you win all of the time, then they'll see through your deception!

You need `r_p_s_cheat` to __win__ 88-92% of the time and __lose__ 8-12% of the time!
In other words, you should __never__ tie!

Note: The testing ___will___ check to see that this condition is fulfilled!

If you believe your solution will work, but doesn't on the first try, submit again!
