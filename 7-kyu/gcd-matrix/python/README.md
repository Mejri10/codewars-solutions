You were given two **valid** integer lists with a random number of elements (1 <= n <= 100). Create a gcd matrix and calculate the average of all values. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)

    a = [1,2,3]
    b = [4,5,6]
    gcd(a,b) = [[1, 2, 1],
                [1, 1, 1],
                [1, 2, 3]]
    average(gcd(a,b)) = 1.444
    
Return a float value formated with 3 decimal places.
