Your task here is to generate a list of prime numbers, starting from 2.

One way of doing this is using python's `generators`.

In case you choose to use `generators`, notice that the generator object should contain all the generated prime numbers, from 2 to an upper limit (included) provided as the argument to the function. If the input limit is less than 2 (including negatives), it should return an empty list.

Each iteration of the generator will yield one prime number. See [this link](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) for reference.

The generator object will be converted to a list outside the code, within the test cases.

There will be no check if you are using `generators` or `lists`, so use the one you feel more confortable with.


### Examples
Some expected results:


```python
list(generate_primes(10)) = [2, 3, 5, 7]
list(generate_primes(23)) = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]
list(generate_primes(28)) = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]
list(generate_primes(-1)) = []
```

Good luck!
