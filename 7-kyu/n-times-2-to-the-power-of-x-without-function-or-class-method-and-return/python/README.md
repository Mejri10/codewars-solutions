Your goal is to create something called `puzzle` which is equivalent  to function `n_time2_power_x(n, x)` (see below) where `n` and `x` are positive integers.

__IMPORTANT__: `puzzle` must not be a `function` or `method` and your solution mustn't contain `return` keyword.

Enjoy! :)

```python
def n_time2_power_x(n, x):
    return n * 2 ** x
```
