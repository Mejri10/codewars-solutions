Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers `(1 <= n <= 100)` and the square of their sum. For example, when `n = 10`:

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:

```(1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025```

The sum of the squares of first ten natural numbers is :

```1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385```

Hence the difference between square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of those numbes is `3025 - 385 = 2640`.

## Example

```ruby
difference_of_squares(10)
# => 2640
```
```javascript
differenceOfSquares(10) // => 2640
```
```php
difference_of_squares(10); // => 2640
```
```csharp
Kata.DifferenceOfSquares(10) == 2640
```
