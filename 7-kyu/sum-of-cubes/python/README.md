Write a function that takes a positive integer n, sums all the cubed values from 1 to n, and returns that sum.

Assume that the input n will always be a positive integer.

Examples:

```python
sum_cubes(2)
> 9 
# sum of the cubes of 1 and 2 is 1 + 8

sum_cubes(3)
> 36 
# sum of the cubes of 1, 2, and 3 is 1 + 8 + 27
```

```r
sum_cubes(2)
[1] 9

sum_cubes(3)
[1] 36
```

```csharp
Kata.SumCubes(2) => 9 // sum of the cubes of 1 and 2 is 1 + 8

Kata.SumCubes(3) => 27 // sum of the cubes of 1, 2, and 3 is 1 + 8 + 27
```
