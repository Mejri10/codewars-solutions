In this kata, you will write an arithmetic list which is basically a list that contains consecutive terms in the sequence.
<br />
You will be given three parameters :
<ul>
    <li>`first` the first term in the sequence</li>
    <li>`c` the constant that you are going to <strong>ADD</strong> ( since it is an arithmetic sequence...)</li>
    <li>`l` the number of terms that should be `return`ed</li>
</ul>
