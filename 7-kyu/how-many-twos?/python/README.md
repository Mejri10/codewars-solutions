Write a function that returns the number of '2's in the factorization of a number.  
For example,
```python
two_count(24)
```
```ruby
two_count(24)
```
```javascript
twoCount(24)
```
```coffeescript
twoCount 24
```
```haskell
twoCount 24
```
```csharp
TwoCount(24)
```
```clojure
two-count 24
```
should return 3, since the factorization of 24 is 2^3 x 3
```python
two_count(17280)
```
```ruby
two_count(17280)
```
```javascript
twoCount(17280)
```
```coffeescript
twoCount 17280
```
```haskell
twoCount 17280
```
```csharp
TwoCount(17280)
```
```clojure
two-count 17280
```
should return 7, since the factorization of 17280 is 2^7 x 5 x 3^3  
The number passed to two_count (twoCount)  will always be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
