[Strive][1] is a new developer-centric service that is focused on presenting software developers with jobs that excite us. Strive discovers these jobs for developers based on a number of factors.

One of the simplest, yet most important factors is compensation. As developers we know how much money we need to support our lifestyle, so we generally have a rough idea of the minimum salary we would be satisfied with. 

Let's give this a try. We'll create a function `match` which takes a `candidate` and a `job`, which will either return a boolean indicating whether the job is a valid match for the candidate. 

A candidate will have a minimum salary, so it will look like this:

```javascript
let candidate = {
  minSalary: 120000
}
```
```ruby
candidate = {
  'min_salary': 120000
}
```
```python
candidate = {
  'min_salary': 120000
}
```
```csharp
Candidate candidate = 
  new Candidate(MinSalary: 120000);
```

A job will have a maximum salary, so it will look like this: 

```javascript 
let job = {
  maxSalary: 140000
}
```
```ruby
job = { 
  'max_salary': 140000
}
```
```python
job = {
  'max_salary': 140000
}
```
```csharp
Job job = 
  new Job(MaxSalary: 140000);
```

If either the candidate's minimum salary or the job's maximum salary is not present, throw an error. 

For a valid match, the candidate's minimum salary must be less than or equal to the job's maximum salary. However, let's also include 10% wiggle room (deducted from the candidate's minimum salary) in case the candidate is a rockstar who enjoys programming on Codewars in their spare time. The company offering the job may be able to work something out.

Of course, compensation is only one filter that will help lead to our satisfaction. What other factors can [Strive][1] use to discover jobs that will excite developers?
