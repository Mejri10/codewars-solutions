Write a function which takes two arguments and returns all numbers which are divisible by given divisor. First argument is array of numbers and the second is divisor.

### Example 
```javascript
divisibleBy([1,2,3,4,5,6], 2) == [2,4,6]
```
```python
divisible_by([1,2,3,4,5,6], 2) == [2,4,6]
```
```ruby
divisible_by([1,2,3,4,5,6], 2) == [2,4,6]
```
```javascript
divisibleBy([1,2,3,4,5,6], 2) == [2,4,6]
```
```csharp
DivisibleBy(new int[]{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 2) == new int[] {2, 4, 6}
```
